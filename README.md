- For those of you who would like to get started with Foundry, you can perform the exercises of Foundry version after completing the hardhat version. I've tried to keep the files similar to the hardhat version so you can understand what a particular line of code in Foundry does ðŸ”¥ This will help you to learn Foundry in a very practical way ðŸ˜€

- Once you are familiar with foundry tests, try to implement them yourself ðŸ’ª.

## Quick Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnny-sch-course/foundry-sch-exercises-part-2

cd foundry-sch-exercises-part-2

forge init --force
```

## Running the tests

- General command:

  ```bash
  forge test --match-contract {Contract_Name}
  ```

  ```bash
  forge test --match-contract TestDEX1
  ```

- Forking Mainnet:

  ```bash
  forge test --fork-url $ETH_RPC_URL --fork-block-number $BLOCK_NUMBER --match-contract {Contract_Name}
  ```

- To see step-wise execution of your exploit, append following to the commands

  ```bash
  -vvvvv
  ```
